Yes I can hear they cut us off somehow Im waiting and I want your asnwer now Is there still room for me Neath the old apple tree Where there once was a bench for two Oh that bench wasnt long And you know it wasnt strong When I sat there with you Ive got fare back to Maine And Ill jump on a train If your heart beats as fond and as true. Its a regular brute of. KEEP ON THE SUNNY SIDE. Who intimately lives with rain.</p>
