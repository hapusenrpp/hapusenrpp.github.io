<p>To see a Christmas tree in your dream symbolizes family celebrations gatherings and familial relationships. Their arrival will gladden you and you will make sure to help that person feel at home at your place. It also signifies a passage of time self-development and spiritual enlightenment. To see presents with yellow and black ribbon predicts disassociation. The symbolic meaning of the Christmas tree is deeply rooted in history.</p>
