<p>Recipe for Christmas Tree Water. Most Christmas tree stands will hold about a gallon of water and they should be. So a tree with a 4-inch-diameter trunk will soak up a gallon of water every day. So the next time someone tells you to add ketchup or something more bizarre to your Christmas tree stand dont believe it. This type is also nice in cut arrangements as well as garlands and wreaths.</p>
