<p>John Heywoods proverb collection in 1546 has it Ye cannot see the wood for the trees A modern twist was provided by C. See The Forest Through The Trees Mountain Design Raglan Baseball. Sometimes we cant see the forest through the trees. Looking up you recognize that you must get to the top of the trees to have a clear view of where you are.
