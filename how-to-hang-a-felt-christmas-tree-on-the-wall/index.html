<p>It is the most wonderful time of the year. No Christmas tree would be complete this year without a little Olaf Frozen magic. It would have taken me a long time and significantly more greenery and cost to make a garland that long but by using the existing faux garland I already had a good base. So I thought a round Christmas sign would be perfect for that location. Why not extend the O Christmas Tree delight.</p>

<p>From DIY Christmas ornaments to Christmas Mason jars there are tons of dollar tree Christmas craft ideas to make for adults and even kids. Why not extend the O Christmas Tree delight. Choosing just one to take home can be hard and if your beautifully decorated tree leaves you inspired to decorate two or three more youre not alone. The tree is sturdy I was able to hang some ornaments the red Christmas ball is pretty and was tucked safely inside the blue blanket the music is loud and plays the Peanuts soundtrack doesnt go on and on but it isnt very short either and the height is just right for me. Which means its time to get your DIY on and wow your family and friends with the most spectacular Christmas ever.</p>
