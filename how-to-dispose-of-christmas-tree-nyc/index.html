<p>America needs to rethink and reduce the way it generates plastics because so much of the material is littering the oceans and other waters the National Academy of Sciences says in a new report. Arsonist torched Christmas tree in Oaklands Jack London Square days before Fox News tree was set alight by homeless drug offender in NYC. Locals believe that efforts to dispose of the bodies. I think its cute it makes me laugh and it takes up almost no space the rest of the year. Meanwhile it was a bear specialist park ranger Tom Mazzarisi who stumbled upon the misplaced ursine while cleaning up part of a trailTeddy was sodden and looked very unloved sitting alone in melted snow. The normal protocol was to dispose of found items that arent worth much monetarily but Mazzarisi was charmed by the sad plushie for some.</p>
