<p>And theres that old oak tree that I used to play on. Birds singing in a sycamore tree Dream a little dream of me Say nighty night and kiss me Just hold me tight and tell me you miss me While Im alone and blue as can be Dream a little dream of me Stars fading but I linger on dear Still craving your kiss Im longing to linger till dawn dear Just saying this Sweet dreams till sunbeams find you. And as the Savior passed him by He looked up in the tree And he said Zacchaeus you come down from there. Then I awake and look around me At four grey walls that surround me And I realize. The standard verses read.</p>

<p>For Im going to your house today for Im going to your house today Zacchaeus came down from that tree as happy as he could be. It has since been recorded by numerous other music artists. And as the Savior passed him by He looked up in the tree And he said Zacchaeus you come down from there. Youre a grand old flag Youre a high-flying flag And forever in peace may you wave. Dont Sit Under the Apple Tree With Anyone Else but Me is a popular song that was made famous by Glenn Miller and by the Andrews Sisters during World War II.</p>

<p>And theres that old oak tree that I used to play on. Its lyrics are the words of two young lovers who pledge their fidelity while one of them is away serving in the war. For Im going to your house today for Im going to your house today Zacchaeus came down from that tree as happy as he could be. Down the lane I walk with my sweet Mary Hair of gold and lips like cherries. Yes I was only dreaming.</p>
